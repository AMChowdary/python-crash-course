#If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
guests = ['Albert Einstein', 'Mahatma Gandhi', 'Marie Curie']
print("Dear " + guests[0] + ", I would be honored to have you at my dinner.")
print("Dear " + guests[1] + ", I would be honored to have you at my dinner.")
print("Dear " + guests[2] + ", I would be honored to have you at my dinner.")
