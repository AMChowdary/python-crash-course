#Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
transportation = ['Honda motorcycle', 'Tesla car', 'Boeing 747']
print("I would like to own a " + transportation[0] + ".")
print("I would like to own a " + transportation[1] + ".")
print("I would like to own a " + transportation[2] + ".")
