# Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# •	 Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')

# •	 Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
print("\nIs car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
print("\nIs car == 'toyota'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'toyota')
print("\nIs car == 'honda'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'honda')
print("\nIs car == 'nissan'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'nissan')
print("\nIs car == 'ford'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'ford')
